// Instruction 2: Create a username model (UsernameModel), with a String _value as it's parameter.
// It will have 2 functions, a getter (with keyword "get", refer to the file number_model.dart for help)
// and a setValue function, which will set _value to the new value passed, and notify the listeners.

// Note: You can make this field either nullable (using String?) OR default the string to a certain value. 
// This will come back later in the instructions, so keep note of what you did.
